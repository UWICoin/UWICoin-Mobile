## Project scope

UWICoin is a form of cryptocurrency, base on the <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled">Ripple API</a> to be used as a proof of concept for The University of the West Indies campuses in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The currency will have a 1:1 ratio to the lowest form of physical currency, the Jamaican Dollar (JAM).

The <a href="https://github.com/DarionHernandez/UWICoin-mobile">UWICoin mobile application</a>, created using Ionic 3 and Cordova, will be used as the mechanism for students to make transactions using UWICoin at outlets around the campus that accept the currency.
